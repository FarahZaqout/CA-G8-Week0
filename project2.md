# Week 0 2nd Project

## TODO APP

* I can add a todo with a title and details.
* I can add a date for the single todo.
* I can click on my todo to mark it as a completed task.
  * The completed todos should have a different color.
* I can delete my todo.
* I can sort my todos based on the date.
* I can search for a specific todo by its title.
* I can display my todos as a grid of two columns or as a list of one column.
   * should have a button to switch between both ways.

* I should be able to expand the details by clicking on the todo's title.

* I want to keep my todos saved after closing the page.

**Important Note:** The app should be accessible and responsive

**Hints:** 
* You can define your todos as objects and store them in an array of objects like this one
  ```javascript	
     [
	     {id: 1, title: "first todo", details: "this is my first todo", dateToComplete: "2146464", done: false}
     ]
  ```

* You can use methods like `filter`, `map`, `sort`, `spread operator(...)`, `concat`, `includes`.
* You can search for `local storage` to help you save your todos.
