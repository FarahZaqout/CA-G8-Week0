# Week 0 4th Project

## Movie APP

***[Reference](https://dribbble.com/shots/5773537-TV-Interface-motion)*** :grin:

* I want to be able to see all the available movies
* I want to click on the pic and see the movie details
* I want to be able to change the background based on the movie I clicked
* I want to be able to add a movie with all information:
  * movie title
  * movie thumbnails(url)
  * movie background image(url)
  * movie rating(dropdown list)
  * movie duration
  * movie release date
  * movie genre checkbox
    * should have a group of checkboxes
    * should be able to tick more than one checkbox

**Important Note:** The app should be **accessible**, **responsive**, and should save its state even after closing the page `local storage`
